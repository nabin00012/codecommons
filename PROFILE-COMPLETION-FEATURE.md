# Student Profile Completion Feature

## Overview
Implemented a complete student profile onboarding system where new students are prompted to complete their profile with additional information after login. This helps with identity verification and provides a better personalized experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Completion Page (`/complete-profile`)
**Location:** `app/complete-profile/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Beautiful gradient UI matching the site's design theme
- Required fields:
  - Phone Number
  - USN (University Seat Number) - converted to uppercase
  - College Email/ID
  - Department (dropdown selection)
- Optional fields:
  - Student ID
- Skip option for users who want to complete it later
- Information box explaining why the data is needed
- Form validation
- Success toast notifications
- Automatic redirect to dashboard after completion

**Design:**
- Gradient card with glassmorphism effect
- Icon-based field labels for better UX
- Loading states during submission
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 2. API Endpoint for Profile Completion
**Location:** `app/api/users/complete-profile/route.ts`

**Features:**
- POST endpoint to update user profile
- Authentication required (uses JWT token from cookies)
- Validates required fields (phone, usn, collegeId, department)
- Checks for duplicate USN to prevent conflicts
- Converts USN to uppercase automatically
- Updates user document in MongoDB
- Sets `profileCompleted` flag to true
- Returns updated user data for context refresh

**Validation:**
- Ensures USN is unique across all users
- Validates all required fields are present
- Proper error messages for validation failures

### 3. Database Schema Updates
**New User Fields:**
- `profileCompleted` (boolean) - Tracks if profile is complete
- `phone` (string, optional) - Student's phone number
- `usn` (string, optional) - University Seat Number
- `studentId` (string, optional) - Student ID card number
- `collegeId` (string, optional) - College email/ID for verification

**Updated Files:**
- `lib/context/user-context.tsx` - Added new fields to User interface
- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Initialize new fields on registration
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Return new fields in login response

### 4. Automatic Redirect Logic
**Location:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Checks if user is a student with incomplete profile
- Automatically redirects to `/complete-profile` page
- Only applies to students (not teachers/admins)
- Runs after user data is loaded

### 5. User Context Updates
**Location:** `lib/context/user-context.tsx`

**Updates:**
- Extended User interface with new profile fields
- Updated session fetch to include new fields
- All existing code compatible (fields are optional)

## User Flow

### For New Students:
1. **Register** → Create account with name, email, password
2. **Login** → Authenticate with credentials
3. **Redirect** → Automatically taken to `/complete-profile`
4. **Fill Form** → Complete profile with additional information
5. **Submit** → Data saved to database, `profileCompleted = true`
6. **Dashboard** → Redirected to main dashboard

### For Existing Students:
- Can skip profile completion initially
- Can complete profile later from settings
- Profile fields are optional, won't break existing functionality

## Benefits

### For Students:
- Personalized experience
- Connect with classmates using USN
- Verified identity through college email
- Better matchmaking for study groups

### For Administrators:
- Verify student authenticity
- Contact students directly
- Better analytics and reporting
- Prevent fake accounts

### For Platform:
- Improved data quality
- Better user engagement
- Enhanced security
- Community trust

## Technical Details

### Authentication:
- Uses JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Token validation on all profile update requests
- Secure cookie settings (httpOnly, sameSite: lax)

### Database:
- MongoDB collections: `users`
- Atomic updates with `$set` operator
- Unique constraint validation for USN
- Timestamps for tracking (createdAt, updatedAt)

### UI/UX:
- shadcn/ui components (Card, Input, Button, Label)
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide icons for visual clarity
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Dark mode support

### Performance:
- Client-side validation before API call
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states during async operations

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration:**
   - Existing users will have `profileCompleted = false` or undefined
   - System handles this gracefully with optional fields
   - No breaking changes for existing data

2. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - All new fields are optional in TypeScript
   - API endpoints handle missing fields
   - UI checks for field existence before display

3. **Production Checklist:**
   - [ ] Test with production database
   - [ ] Verify cookie settings (secure: true in prod)
   - [ ] Check CORS and CSP policies
   - [ ] Monitor API endpoint performance
   - [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

## Support

For questions or issues with the profile completion feature:
1. Check user context is loading properly
2. Verify JWT token is present in cookies
3. Check MongoDB connection and collections
4. Review browser console for errors
5. Test API endpoints directly with Postman
